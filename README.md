Fitness is an important aspect in todayâ€™s society as a rapidly growing industry. Many people exercise to live a healthier lifestyle but also for sport performance. Several machines have been invented to exercise the body in different ways and help stay fit although there are very few machines specifically meant for wheelchair users. The wheelchair dynamometer is designed for wheelchair users to exercise, like an able-bodied individual, when needed as well as track performance parameters important in their field of sport. With a resistance setting, the dynamometer can accommodate a wide range of users at different fitness levels that can see workout/performance parameters through interaction with the included display.
